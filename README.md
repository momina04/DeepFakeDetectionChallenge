# Deepfake Detection Challenge

My solution to the [Kaggle Deepfake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge) to achieve top 1% on the public and private leaderboard.

The final sumbission used was an ensemble of 3 models:
- Single Frame classifier B6-EfficientNet pretrained on Imagenet
- Single Frame classifier B6-EfficientNet pretrained on Imagenet (with Cutmix data augmentation)
- Sequence of (5) frames classifier using an LSTM with B6-EfficientNet backbone with the cutmixed model as the pretrained weights while only training the head LSTM component of the network.

Attempted various approaches at deep fake audio detection but decided against including them in the final submission due to not performing well during training.
